Hi, 
This code can split an MP3

First click on Read File and select source MP3
Then use the upper slider to set how many seconds the new MP3 must last
from the beginning
And clikc Save to create the new MP3

Or use the upper slider to set the start of the new MP3 and use the
lower slider to set the end of the new MP3
And click Save Xtra to create the new MP3

The 'WriteTag' function is from another coder (see clsMp3 for the Pscode link

U can use this code for whatever you wan't, but please leave credits for me (Sjoerd) or
when you use the class or the 'WriteTag' function leave credits for this coder
Thanks and much fun!!!

Greetings, Sjoerd

Note:
You need Windows Media Player 9 to use this code.
You can download it @ microsoft.com
If U don't wan't to download or install Windows Media Player 9 you can just remove the
control and be sure to delete/disable/invisible cmdPlay button.
I only use Windows Media Player to play the source MP3.

Also you need the MMContrl.ocx.
I think it's standard in Windows but I don't know for sure, I don't know a place to download
it either, so if anyone know it, plz give a comment.
