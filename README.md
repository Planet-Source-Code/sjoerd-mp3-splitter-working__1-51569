### Description

Hi,

This code can split a MP3 file and save it as new file.

U can easily cut out the best pieces from a MP3 and save it as a new one.

The GUI looks bad but it works and it's fast and I think that's important.

I've uploaded coz there's only one MP3 splitter to be found on pscode (as far as i've seen) and it isn't finished jet.

Just try and vote/comment
